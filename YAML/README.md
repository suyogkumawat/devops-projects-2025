# Advanced YAML Features for DevOps

Welcome! This README explains **advanced YAML features** in a simple and beginner-friendly way. These concepts are used in real-world tools like **Kubernetes**, **Docker Compose**, **Ansible**, and **CI/CD pipelines**.

## üöÄ Advanced YAML Features ‚Äî Explained Simply

Once you‚Äôre comfortable with basic YAML (key-value, lists, nesting), here are some powerful features that help you write cleaner and more reusable configuration files.

---

### üîÅ 1. Anchors (&) and Aliases (*) ‚Äî Reuse Code Without Rewriting

YAML lets you **reuse parts of your configuration** to avoid repeating the same data again and again.

```yaml
defaults: &default_settings
  retries: 3
  timeout: 30

service1:
  <<: *default_settings
  host: example.com
```

- `&default_settings`: Creates an **anchor** named `default_settings`.
- `*default_settings`: **References** the anchor.
- `<<: *default_settings`: **Merges** the key-values into `service1`.

**Why use this?**  
To keep your YAML DRY (**Don't Repeat Yourself**) and more maintainable.

### üßæ 2. Multi-line Strings ‚Äî Write Big Text Blocks

If you need to include logs, descriptions, or other long texts, YAML supports two styles:

#### Literal Style (`|`) ‚Äî Keeps New Lines
```yaml
note: |
  This is a multiline
  string in literal style.
```
Output keeps line breaks **as written**.

#### Folded Style (`>`) ‚Äî Joins Lines with Spaces
```yaml
summary: >
  This is a folded
  style multiline string.
```
Output becomes: `This is a folded style multiline string.`

**When to use:**
- Use `|` when formatting matters (e.g., logs)
- Use `>` for paragraphs or messages

---

### üß© 3. Complex/Nested Structures ‚Äî Real-World Format

YAML supports nested data like lists inside maps and vice versa.

```yaml
services:
  - name: web
    replicas: 2
    ports:
      - containerPort: 80

  - name: db
    replicas: 1
    ports:
      - containerPort: 5432
```

- `services` is a **list**.
- Each item is a **map** with its own keys.
- Inside each service, you can **nest deeper** (e.g., ports).

**Use Case:** Common in Kubernetes, Docker Compose, and Ansible.

### üß± 4. Block vs Flow Style ‚Äî Two Ways to Write the Same Thing

#### Block Style (preferred):
```yaml
colors:
  - red
  - green
  - blue

user:
  name: Alice
  age: 30
```

#### Flow Style (compact):
```yaml
colors: [red, green, blue]
user: { name: "Alice", age: 30 }
```

- Block style is easier to read.
- Flow style is shorter, useful for small/inline data.

### üìÑ 5. Multiple YAML Documents in One File

You can include more than one YAML document in a single file using `---` to separate them.

```yaml
# Document 1
---
name: Document1
value: 123

# Document 2
---
name: Document2
value: 456
...
```

- `---` starts a new document
- `...` ends a document (optional)

**Use Case:** Kubernetes multi-resource files, CI/CD workflows

| Feature               | Use Case                           | Syntax Example                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Anchors & Aliases    | Reuse config blocks                | `&name`, `*name`, `<<:`       |
| Multiline Strings    | Logs, descriptions, big messages   | `|` for breaks, `>` for fold   |
| Nested Structures    | Real-world config hierarchy        | List of maps, nested maps     |
| Block vs Flow Style  | Readable vs compact formats        | `- item` vs `[item1, item2]`   |
| Multi-doc YAML       | Multiple resources in one file     | `---` for new doc             |
